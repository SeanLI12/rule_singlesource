      <p>
        A parlay bet is defined as individual bets which link two or more selections in a single bet. Each selection
        chosen in the parlay must win for the parlay ticket to be successful. If the first selection is a winning bet,
        the winnings
        and the stake are carried over on to the second selection. This continues until all selections are winning bets
        or one selection is a losing bet. Some parlays are a combination of different parlays in a single parlay ticket,
        e.g. A
        Yankee is a combination of 11 different parlay bets. Please see the "Types of Parlay Bets" section for more
        information.
      </p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <p>A parlay treble of $100 is placed on the following three selections:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Manchester United @ 1.80</li>
        <li>Chelsea @ 1.50</li>
        <li>Arsenal @ 1.66</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If all three selections win, the return on the parlay is $448.20. This is broken down as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bet 1: Manchester United 1.80 x $100 = Return of $180.</li>
        <li>Bet 2: Chelsea 1.50 x $180 = Return of $270.</li>
        <li>Bet 3: Arsenal 1.66 x $270 = Return of $448.20.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Parlay Points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The company allows a maximum of ten selections to be combined in a parlay bet.</li>
        <li>All selections are subject to the relevant sports rules.</li>
        <li>
          Not all markets will be available for parlay betting. If you see in the bet slip that you cannot combine two
          unrelated selections (see below for details on related parlays), then one of the selections is not available
          for parlay
          betting.
        </li>
        <li>Parlay bets can be placed across sports and across days.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="sbk-rules-title">Related Selection in a Parlays</div>
      <p>Parlay bets, which combine selections that are related in the same event or where the outcome of one market
        could affect the outcome of another market, are not accepted.</p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <p>The following double is not accepted as it is seen as a related parlay:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Manchester United to win in the 1 X 2 market @ odds of 1.80</li>
        <li>Manchester United to win 2-0 in the correct score market @ odds of 7.0</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If Manchester United win 2-0, the combined odds would be 12.6. However, the odds should only be 7.0 because if
        Manchester United win 2-0, they will automatically have won in the 1 X 2 market.</p>
      <p>Parlay bets that combine selections relating to the same team or player, even though they are settled at
        different times, are also not accepted as the outcome of one could affect the outcome of the other:</p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Manchester Untied to reach the Champions League Final @6.0</li>
        <li>Manchester United to win the Champions League @ 10.0</li>
        <li>Combined odds of 60.0</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This parlay is considered related as the result of the second selection impacts the first selection. If
        Manchester Untied win the Champions League, they will automatically have reached the final. Therefore, the odds
        can only be 10.0.
      </p>
      <p>The Company reserves the right to void part or all of a parlay bet if it is seen to be a related parlay.</p>

      <a name="parlaypush"></a>
      <div class="sbk-rules-title">Parlay Push</div>
      <p>
        In the event that any part of the parlay bet is voided or is a push (as in the example below), the parlay bet
        will still stand and any winning selections will be carried forward to the remaining selections, as in the case
        of the
        following Treble:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bet 1: Chelsea (-0.5) - Chelsea win.</li>
        <li>Bet 2: Manchester United (-1) - Manchester United win 1-0.</li>
        <li>Bet 3: Arsenal (-0.5) - Arsenal win.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As Manchester United only win 1-0 with a (-1) Asian Handicap, that part of the parlay bet is a push. Therefore,
        the "Chelsea win" bet is carried forward to the "Arsenal win" bet and the parlay bet becomes a winning Double on
        Chelsea
        and Arsenal instead of the initial parlay bet of a Treble. The push part of the bet is calculated by multiplying
        the carried over stake by 1.
      </p>
      <p>Examples of how the push is calculated:</p>
      <p>Example 1: A selection is settled as a push:</p>

      <div class="sbk-rules-title">Types of Parlay Bets</div>
      <p>There is a variety of parlay bets offered by the company. Below is a grid showing all the permutations of each
        type of parlay bet.</p>
      <div class="tableContainer"></div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>A detailed breakdown of each parlay bet type is listed below:</p>
      <p><strong>Double</strong></p>
      <ul style="list-style: none;">
        <li>A Double consists of one bet involving two selections from different events. Both selections must be
          successful to guarantee a return.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Treble</strong></p>
      <ul style="list-style: none;">
        <li>A Treble consists of 1 bet involving 3 selections in different events. All must be successful to guarantee a

      <br>
      <p><strong>Accumulator</strong></p>
      <ul style="list-style: none;">
        <li>
          An Accumulator is one bet with four or more different selections. All selections must be successful to
          guarantee a return. An Accumulator with four selections is referred to as a Four-Fold, or 4-Fold; an
          accumulator with five
          selections is known as a Five-Fold, or 5-Fold, and so on up to Ten-Fold, or 10-Fold.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Trixie</strong></p>
      <ul style="list-style: none;">
        <li>A Trixie is a combined parlay bet on three different selections, consisting of 4 separate bets. It is broken
          down into 3 Doubles and 1 Treble. There must be a minimum of two successful selections to guarantee a return.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Yankee</strong></p>
      <ul style="list-style: none;">
