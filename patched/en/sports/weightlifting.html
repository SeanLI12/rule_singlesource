                <li>For betting purposes, participants awarded Gold, Silver and Bronze at the medal ceremony will be
                    deemed as the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winner. </li>
                <li>Podium positions will count as the official results, regardless of any subsequent disqualification
                    or amendment to the result. </li>
                <li>In head to head events, both competitors must start the fight for the bets to stand. </li>
                <li>If the event starts before the scheduled time, only bets placed before the event commenced will be
                    considered valid. Bets placed after the event commenced will be considered void. This excludes
                    In-Play bet types. </li>
                <li>Bets will be settled according to the official I.W.F result immediately at the end of the event,
                    even in the absence of a medal ceremony. </li>
